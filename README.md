# Walmart Sales Analysis
This project analyzes Walmart’s sales data to uncover how factors like temperature, holidays, and fuel prices influence sales trends. The goal is to identify key patterns and provide data-driven insights that can help improve overall revenue performance.

## Data Sources
The primary dataset used for this analysis is the “Walmart_Sales.csv” file, containing historical sales data of Walmart. This dataset is downloaded from Kaggle.

## Tools
1. SQL Server (Data Analysis/Data Exploration)

2. Power BI(Data Visualization)

## Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the data preparation phase of the project, we performed the following tasks:

1. Data loading and inspection (in SQL server)
2. Handling of missing values from the dataset and checking for any inconsistencies
3. Data cleaning and formatting (adding new temperature column and populating it with new values)
## Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA is used to summarize the sales data and allows us gain a deeper understanding of the dataset. It answers key questions such as:

1. What is the total number of distinct stores?
2. What is the total sales for each store?
3. Which store performed the best and which store performed the worst?
4. What is the average weekly sales during holiday periods and non-holiday periods?
5. What are the peak sales periods for each year?
6. Do factors such as fuel price, CPI, holidays and temperature affect sales revenue?

## Findings
After careful analysis, the results are as follows:

1. Store 20 has the highest sales amount of $301,397,792.46 while Store 33 has the lowest sales amount of $37,160,221.96.
2. Sales revenue has been slowly rising over the past 3 years, with sales peaking around December each year. This increase in sales is likely due to the holiday season where people are busy shopping for Christmas goods and decorations.
3. Average CPI and fuel prices have been gradually increasing over time, with fuel prices increasing significantly from 2010 to 2011.
4. There is no significant correlation between fuel prices and sales revenue.
5. Average sales are at their highest during holiday seasons regardless of CPI or fuel prices.
6. Average sales are the lowest when the temperature is hot(>25 degrees) while sales are the highest when the temperature is moderate(between 0 degrees and 25 degrees).
## Recommendations
Based on analysis above, here are some recommended actions to take in order to increase sales revenue:

1. Offering special promotions during peak seasons to maximise revenue and attract more customers.
2. Analyzing the differences between Store 20 and Store 33 to figure out the reasons behind the large discrepancy in sales. For instance promotions, product placement, store environment, customer service, location.
3. As sales drop during hotter days, Walmart can run targeted promotions on specific products such as beverages, cooling applicances and swimwear.
4. During hotter days where customers are reluctant to shop in physical stores, Walmart can increase sales by offering discount vouchers whenever consumers shop online.
5. As sales are the highest in moderate temperatures, more emphasis should be placed on outdoor products such as gardening tools, sports apparel as well as sports equipment. Beauty products may also see a rise in sales as people tend to repair their damaged skin and hair after cold periods.
6. Since CPI and fuel prices do not affect sales significantly, Walmart should focus on their customer service and increasing customer satisfaction so as to build a more loyal customer base.
Limitations
Converted fuel_price and CPI column to 2 decimal places for easier analysis and readability.
Created a new column for temperature called temperature_celcius as the original temperature column was recorded in Kelvin. The newly created column was then populated with values in Celcius after conversion.
